## Problem 1

### 1.

**(a)**

**Descriptions of variables:**

$x_k$: the <u>state</u> vector describing the location and orientation of the vehicle at time instant $k$

$u_k$: the <u>control</u> vector applied at time $k-1$ to drive the vehicle to state $x_k$ at time $k$ (similar to <u>velocity</u>)

$m$: the (estimated) location vector of the <u>landmarks</u>

$z_k$: the <u>observations</u> of the locations of the landmarks at time $k$

**Descriptions of distributions:**

$P(x_k|x_{k-1}, u_k)$: <u>state transition</u> model, i.e. the probability distribution of state $x_k$ at time $k$ given the preceding state $x_{k-1}$ and the applied control $u_k$.

$P(z_k|x_k, m)$: <u>observation</u> model, i.e. the probability distribution of observing $z_k$ given the current state $x_k$ and the (estimated) map $m$

$P(x_{k-1}, m|Z_{0:k-1}, U_{0:k-1}, x_0)$: the <u>prior</u> belief distribution of the robot's state and the map

$P(x_k, m|Z_{0:k-1}, U_{0:k}, x_0)$: the belief distribution of the robot's state and the map <u>after</u> taking an action but <u>before</u> making an observation

$P(x_k, m|Z_{0:k}, U_{0:k}, x_0)$: the <u>posterior</u> belief distribution of the robot's state and the map

**Equation (4):**

The belief distribution of the robot's state and the map <u>after</u> taking an action but <u>before</u> making an observation at time $k$, conditioned on 1) the observations from time $0$ to time $k-1$ , 2) the actions from time $0$ to time $k$ and 3) the initial state $x_0$, <u>is equal to</u> the <u>sum</u> of the transition probabilities of state $x_k$ given preceding state $x_{k-1}$ and applied control $u_k$ <u>times</u> the <u>prior</u> distributions of the robot's state and the map at time $k-1$, conditioned on 1) the observations from time $0$ to time $k-1$ , 2) the actions from time $0$ to time $k-1$ and 3) the initial state $x_0$. (This might be the longest sentence I ever wrote.)

**Equation (5):**

The <u>posterior</u> belief distribution of the robot's state and the map at time $k$, conditioned on 1) the observations from time $0$ to time $k$ , 2) the actions from time $0$ to time $k$ and 3) the initial state $x_0$, <u>is equal to</u> the <u>product</u> of 1) the probability of observing $z_k$ given the current state $x_k$ and map $m$ and 2) the belief distribution of the robot's state and the map <u>after</u> taking an action but <u>before</u> making an observation at time $k$, conditioned on 1) the observations from time $0$ to time $k-1$ , 2) the actions from time $0$ to time $k$ and 3) the initial state $x_0$, divided by the probability of observing $z_k$ at time $k$ given previous observations from time $0$ to time $k-1$ and previous actions from time $0$ to time $k$, which is constant.

**(a)**

The robot is planer, so the dimension of $\hat{x}_{k|k}$ is $3*1$.

There are $n$ landmarks and each is specified by its $x$ and $y$ position, so the dimension of $\hat{m}_k$ is $2n*1$.

The observations can be represented by $\rho$ and $\theta$, so the dimension of $z_k$ should be $2n * 1$.

The other dimensions can be deduced by the equations. They are:

$P_{k|k}$: $(2n+3) * (2n+3)$

$Q_k$: $3 * 3$

$R_k$: $2n * 2n$

$\nabla f$: $3 * 3$

$\nabla h$: $2n * (2n+3)$

$S_k$: $2n * 2n$

$W_k$: $(2n+3) * 2n$

After fixing the typo, Equation (10) becomes $\begin{bmatrix}\hat{x}_{k|k}\\\hat{m}_k\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\hat{x}_{k|k-1}\\\hat{m}_{k-1}\end{bmatrix}+W_k\begin{bmatrix}z_k-h(\hat{x}_{k|k-1}, \hat{m}_{k-1})\end{bmatrix}$.

**(b)**

**Relationship:**

$P_{xx, k|k-1}$ consists of the upper-left $3*3$ box of $P_{k|k-1}$. In other words, $P_{k|k-1}=\begin{bmatrix}P_{xx} & P_{xm} \\ P^T_{xm} & P_{mm}\end{bmatrix}_{k|k-1}$ .

**Obtaining $P_{k|k-1}$**

$P_{mm}$ is the covariance (uncertainty estimate) of the landmarks and it should not change when the robot moves. So $P_{mm, k | k-1} = P_{mm, k-1 | k-1}$.

$P_{xm, k|k-1}$ can be calculated by $\nabla fP_{xm, k-1 | k-1}$.

$P^T_{xm, k|k-1}$ is the transpose of $P_{xm, k|k-1}$, so $P^T_{xm, k|k-1}=P^T_{xm, k-1 | k-1}\nabla f^T$.

So we can obtain $P_{k|k-1}$ by $\begin{bmatrix}P_{xx, k | k-1} & \nabla fP_{xm, k-1 | k-1} \\ P^T_{xm, k-1 | k-1}\nabla f^T & P_{mm, k-1 | k-1}\end{bmatrix}$.
