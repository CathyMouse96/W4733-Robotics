## Problem 1

### (a)

As we can see from the diagram:

$x'=x+\frac{L}{2}cos\theta+\frac{L}{2}cos(\theta+\phi)$

$y'=y+\frac{L}{2}sin\theta+\frac{L}{2}sin(\theta+\phi)$

$\theta'=\theta+\phi$

Differentiate wrt time:

$\dot{x'}=\dot{x}-\frac{L\dot{\theta}}{2}sin\theta-\frac{L(\dot{\theta}+\dot{\phi})}{2}sin(\theta+\phi)​$

$\dot{y'}=\dot{y}+\frac{L\dot{\theta}}{2}cos\theta+\frac{L(\dot{\theta}+\dot{\phi})}{2}cos(\theta+\phi)​$

$\dot{\theta'}=\dot{\theta}+\dot{\phi}​$

So the second link's no-slip constraint in terms of $x$, $y$, $\theta$ and $\phi$ and their velocities is:

$(\dot{x}-\frac{L\dot{\theta}}{2}sin\theta-\frac{L(\dot{\theta}+\dot{\phi})}{2}sin(\theta+\phi))sin(\theta+\phi)-(\dot{y}+\frac{L\dot{\theta}}{2}cos\theta+\frac{L(\dot{\theta}+\dot{\phi})}{2}cos(\theta+\phi))cos(\theta+\phi)=0$

After simplification:

$sin(\theta+\phi)\dot{x}-cos(\theta+\phi)\dot{y}-\frac{L(1+cos\phi)}{2}\dot{\theta}-\frac{L}{2}\dot{\phi}=0​$

### (b)

$\begin{bmatrix}sin\theta&&-cos\theta&&0&&0&&0\\cos\theta&&sin\theta&&0&&-1&&0\\sin(\theta+\phi)&&-cos(\theta+\phi)&&-\frac{L(1+cos\phi)}{2}&&0&&-\frac{L}{2}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\dot{x}\\\dot{y}\\\dot{\theta}\\v\\\dot{\phi}\end{bmatrix}=0​$

Null space of $A^T(q)$ (i.e. the set of all allowed velocities):

$\begin{bmatrix}\dot{x}\\\dot{y}\\\dot{\theta}\\v\\\dot{\phi}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}cos\theta&&0\\sin\theta&&0\\\frac{2sin\phi}{L(cos\phi+1)}&&-\frac{1}{cos\phi+1}\\1&&0\\0&&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}u_1\\u_2\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}cos\theta&&0\\sin\theta&&0\\\frac{2sin\phi}{L(cos\phi+1)}&&-\frac{1}{cos\phi+1}\\1&&0\\0&&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}v\\\dot{\phi}\end{bmatrix}​$

As we can see, the robot has two degrees of freedom, and they correspond to the forward velocity and the relative joint velocity between the two links, respectively.

### (c)

We can see that:

$v=u_1=\sqrt{\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2}​$

$\dot{\phi}=u_2=\frac{2u_1sin\phi}{L}-\dot{\theta}(cos\phi+1)​$

We know that $\theta=Atan2(\dot{y}, \dot{x})​$, so $\dot{\theta}=\frac{\ddot{y}\dot{x}-\ddot{x}\dot{y}}{\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2}​$.

So we need to solve the differential equation $\dot{\phi}=\frac{2\sqrt{\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2}sin\phi}{L}-\frac{\ddot{y}\dot{x}-\ddot{x}\dot{y}}{\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2}(cos\phi+1)$.

This robot has singularities. As we can see from the matrix above, the FK does not exist when $cos\phi+1=0$, i.e. $\phi=\pi$. So the IK will not exist either.

## Problem 2

### (a)

The bicycle starts at $(0.0, 0.0)​$. It moves in this manner because:

1. From $\dot{\phi}(t)=0.3sin(t)​$, we know that $\phi(t)=-0.3cos(t)+c​$ where $c​$ is some constant. Since $\phi(0)=0​$, we know that $c=0.3​$. So $\phi(t)=-0.3cos(t)+0.3\in[0, 0.6]​$. Thus the angle $\phi​$ is always non-negative. This means the robot will always be turning left.
2. From $\dot{\phi}(t)=0.3sin(t)​$, we can also see that the robot will alternatingly turn left slowly, then quickly, then slowly.
3. The bicycle makes a large loop because the rate at which it is turning left is relatively small.

This is the plot of $\sqrt{\dot{x}(t)^2+\dot{y}(t)^2}$ over the time interval. As we can see, $\sqrt{\dot{x}(t)^2+\dot{y}(t)^2}$ is always equal to 1 and thus equal to $v$.

### (b)

![2b_1](/Users/cmouse/Documents/Columbia Spring 2019/W4733 Robotics/hw3/2b_1.png)

The bicycle starts at $(0.0, 0.0)​$. It moves in this manner because:

1. From $\dot{\phi}(t)=0.6sin(t)$, we know that $\phi(t)=-0.6cos(t)+c$ where $c$ is some constant. Since $\phi(0)=0$, we know that $c=0.6$. So $\phi(t)=-0.6cos(t)+0.6\in[0, 1.2]$. Thus the angle $\phi$ is always non-negative. This means the robot will always be turning left.
2. From $\dot{\phi}(t)=0.6sin(t)$, we can also see that the robot will alternatingly turn left slowly, then quickly, then slowly.
3. The bicycle makes small loops because the rate at which it is turning left is relatively large.

The results differ in the size of the loop(s) that the bicycle makes. The reason for this is that in (b) the bicycle turns left at a much faster rate than in (a).

### (c)

![2c_1](/Users/cmouse/Documents/Columbia Spring 2019/W4733 Robotics/hw3/2c_1.png)

We get a very strange graph. This is because the bicycle has singularities. As we can see, the FK does not exist when $\phi=2n\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$ where $n$ is any integer.

The bicycle starts at $(0.0, 0.0)$. From $\dot{\phi}(t)=sin(t)$, we know that $\phi(t)=-cos(t)+c$ where $c$ is some constant. Since $\phi(0)=0$, we know that $c=1.0$. So $\phi(t)=-cos(t)+1.0\in[0, 2.0]$. Note that $\frac{\pi}{2}\approx 1.57$ is in this range! So when $\phi(t)=\frac{\pi}{2}​$, the bicycle will behave strangely.
