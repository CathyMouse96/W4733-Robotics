Bug2 Implementation
Qing Teng (qt2126)

Strategy:
1. Follow m-line until near obstacle, i.e. max value of ahead_range drops below threshold
2. Mark hit point and turn left
3. Move forward
4. Turn right, if still near obstacle, turn left again
5. Repeat 3. and 4. until encounter m-line, i.e. position.y is within accepted range of y_start
6. If position is not the same as marked hit point, and has shorter distance to goal, turn to face goal and repeat from 1. Otherwise, return False.

Parameters:
Threshold of hitting obstacle/goal/count as same point: within 0.30m radius.
Threshold of being "near" obstacle: within 0.80m radius.
Threshold of encountering m-line: within 0.20m radius.
Angular tolerance: 5.0 degrees.
Angular speed: 0.5rad/s.
Linear speed: 0.40m/s.
